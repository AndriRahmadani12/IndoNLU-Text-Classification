# IndoNLU-Text-Classification
This repository contains a project for text classification using the IndoLU dataset. The project leverages TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction and various machine learning algorithms for classification.

## Introduction
Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing text into predefined categories. In this project, I utilized the IndoLU dataset and employed TF-IDF vectorization along with various machine learning algorithms to perform text classification.

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop a text classification model capable of accurately categorizing Indonesian text data. The IndoLU (Indonesian Language Understanding) dataset was used, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was applied for text vectorization. Various machine learning models were then trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model.

## Dataset
The IndoLU dataset contains a collection of Indonesian texts labeled with different categories. It is a comprehensive dataset that provides a robust foundation for developing and testing text classification models.

## Key Features

- **IndoLU Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset for Indonesian language understanding tasks.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Effective feature extraction technique for text data.
- **Multiple Machine Learning Models**: Exploration and comparison of different machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Detailed evaluation using standard metrics.
